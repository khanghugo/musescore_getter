# musescore_getter (broken as of 2021/05/07 because the patched some part, I am working on a fix)

download pdf, mp3, midi for free because that is what shown to you. Some users are not pro so their thumbnails are low quality PNG. But some do have SVG.

`getter.py url` to download all the files

if you want to download more files, refer to [this](https://github.com/Xmader/musescore-downloader/blob/master/src/scoreinfo.ts) full web version by Xmader. the MSCZ requires token, which is I am not familiar with yet.

you also need these libraries

pip install svglib

pip install pypdf2

pip install img2pdf

pip install bs4

i hope those guys at musescore won't patch this
